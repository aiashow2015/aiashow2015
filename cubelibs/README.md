# README - cubelibs subdirectory

The files here are copies of the libraries that the cube uses. They are downloaded from http://cubetube.org/media/cloudware/library/ and checked into version control since occasionally, they upload broken code to the site. So, feel free to download new versions, but test them before checking them in.

To download new versions of the libraries:

        make cubelibs

in the main directory.
